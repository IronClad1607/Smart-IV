5.Power supply

**Implementation:**

•	Using IoT, we can solve the problem of 'empty bottles’. We’re using LDR sensor which is connected to NodeMcu.

•	LDR will help us detect if the fluid is below a critical level.

•	The NodeMCU will then send their data to the firebase.

•	Buzzer will even notify the patient about the fluid level.

•	The data from the firebase will then be accessed by a mobile application.
